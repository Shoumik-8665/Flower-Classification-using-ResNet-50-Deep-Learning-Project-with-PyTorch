# Flower-Classification-using-ResNet-50-Deep-Learning-Project-with-PyTorch
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and fine-tunes its final layer to classify 102 flower categories from the Oxford Flowers-102 dataset. It's a practical example of transfer learning in computer vision using PyTorch.
 Dataset
Oxford 102 Flower Dataset

Contains 8189 images of flowers categorized into 102 different species.

Divided into training, validation, and test splits.

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet
