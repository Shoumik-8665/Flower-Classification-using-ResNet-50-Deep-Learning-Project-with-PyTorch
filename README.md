# Flower-Classification-using-ResNet-50-Deep-Learning-Project-with-PyTorch
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and fine-tunes its final layer to classify 102 flower categories from the Oxford Flowers-102 dataset. It's a practical example of transfer learning in computer vision using PyTorch.
